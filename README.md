## 📢 Conclusion & Recommendations

### ✅ **Summary of Findings**
- **Amateur-built aircraft tend to have higher accident rates** than certified commercial models.
- **Single-engine aircraft are more vulnerable** to fatal accidents compared to multi-engine planes.
- **Turboprop and jet engines offer better reliability and safety** than piston engines.

### 🚀 **Data-Driven Recommendations**
✅ **Prioritize Commercial & Certified Aircraft**: Investing in well-established, certified aircraft enhances safety and reliability.
✅ **Choose Multi-Engine Aircraft**: They provide redundancy, reducing the risk of total engine failure.
✅ **Invest in Turboprop & Jet-Engine Planes**: These engines are more efficient and have lower accident rates.
